## Compiling

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -a -installsuffix cgo main.go
```

This will give you the statically compiled binary `main`. The binary being statically compiled is important to keep the container... contained.


## Docker

The Dockerfile uses the base image [scratch](http://blog.xebia.com/2014/07/04/create-the-smallest-possible-docker-container/)

It can be built as per:

```bash
docker build -t quay.io/jspc/prox:latest .
```

And, obviously, lives on [quay](http://quay.io/jspc/prox).

## Running

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 quay.io/jspc/prox
```
